### Take your React skills to the next level
Maybe you're learned the basics of React and are wondering where to go next.<br>
Or maybe you're looking to make Reactt development more intuitive for your self so that you can build anything you can imagine.<br>
Well, whatever the case, learning and mastering React design patterns might just be the way to take your software development career to another level. <br>
I'am Uzzal Roy, and I'am a senior software developer and tech educator.<br>
The topics in this course represent many of the things that I look for when interviewing React developer candidates.<br>
Things that will take you from a begineer or intermediate level to an advanced level in React.<br>
Join me this course to learn React's most important design patterns, and see how to take your productivity and intuition in React to the next level.
